In this work, one employ predictive models based on machine learning algorithms to enhance the design space exploration process of combining RAs and GPPs. Using this technique, we were able to achieve a prediction error rate above 2% and reduce the time for exploring the design space up to 104x when comparing with a scenario just using a high-level simulator tool.
